## About Scaling and Database growth.

When the database grows, you’ll have a challenge of how to scale it. There are two common ways:

Scaling up – upgrade the current server to a bigger one with more resources (CPU, RAM, etc). However, getting a bigger server means increasing more costs.


Scaling out – purchase additional servers and add them to the cluster. This is cheaper and more scalable than scaling up. The downside is that it takes 
more effort to manage multiple servers than a big one.


MongoDB was designed to scale out.
